## About 
I love listening to the radio, hearing different voices, new music and discovering new things. This site is designed to combine this, allowing users to find their favourite stations as well as explore sites from all around the world!

The backend of the site relies on the fantastic [Radio Browser API](https://api.radio-browser.info/), which is a great resource for searching and getting more info on radio stations. The [Pyradios Library](https://pypi.org/project/pyradios/) is used in order to communicate with this API more conveniently!

## Agile 

**MVP**: Intuitive radio player that allows search, sort and discovery of radio stations.

Agile processes managed using GitHub projects, this can be seen [here](https://github.com/users/eosull/projects/9).
